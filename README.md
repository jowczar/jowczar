## Public Repositories
My GitHub activity is a mix of private side projects and public university assignments. I should mention that during my professional experience, I primarily used BitBucket for version control and collaboration. So, my public repositories on GitHub might not fully showcase my overall software development journey. But hey, I'd be thrilled to share more code samples and chat about my professional projects if you're interested! Just give me a shout-out!
