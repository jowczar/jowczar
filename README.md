- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jowczar. I'm a fullstack dev. I use GitHub only for open-source projects I do in my free time!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in any challenges, interesting projects, whatever the technology is.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning project management and leadership skills to hopefully make the world a better place. I am also exploring Machine Learning at a slower pace (why days are so short?! So many things to do, so many things to learn!), and willing to start own startup soon.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ~~ jus-owczarek@wp.pl, HMU about anything really, always excited to meet new people!
